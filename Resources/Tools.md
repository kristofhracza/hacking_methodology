# Tunneling and Listeners

## Chisel

[Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. Single executable including both client and server.

```bash
############################# [SERVER] #############################
chisel server --port <port> --reverse


############################# [CLIENTS] #############################
# BASIC client

chisel client <server_ip_and_port> R:<listener_port>:<ip>:<forwarded_port>

# SOCKS PROXY
## Note that socks proxy will start a listener on port 1080
chisel client <server_ip_and_port> R:socks
```

  
### Interaction

One can use `FoxyProxy` for the browser or `proxychains` on the command line to interact with the network.

  

## authbind

*authbind* allows a program which does not or should not run as root to bind to low-numbered ports in a controlled way.

```bash
# Netcat
authbind nc -lvnp <port>

# Python
authbind python -m http.server
```

  

# Active Directory

## BloodHound
[Documentation](https://bloodhound.specterops.io/homel)
BloodHound is used to visualise AD environments and discover attack paths.

#### SharpHound

Data collector for *BloodHound*

- [Releases](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors)

#### bloodhound.py
[Documentation](https://github.com/fox-it/BloodHound.py)
Python based data collection tool for BloodHound
This will run against the domain, so can one run it from a remote machine.

```bash
bloodhound-python -u <username> -p <password> -d <domain> -c All -ns <nameserver>
```


  

## sssd
`sssd` is an open source client for enterprise identity management.
It allows for Linux machines to be joined into an Active Directory domain.

`SSSD` maintains a copy of the database at the path `/var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb`

The corresponding key is stored as a hidden file at the path `/var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey`. By default, the key is only readable if you have root permissions.

Knowing this information one can take a look at those file (if they're present) and extract data from them.

If data cannot be found in those files, one might try to go back one folder to `/var/lib/sss` where they might find some other files which can potentially reveal some info.

Used for disassembling .NET code

  
### Alternatives
*These alternatives are for Linux, since dnSpy is for Windows only*

## Python Executables
Python files can be packed and unpacked to and from a binary.

Use the **[extractor](https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor)** to unpack the binary, then use **[uncompyle6](https://pypi.org/project/uncompyle6/)** to decompile `.pyc` files received from the unpacking process.

Read **[this](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/unpacking-python-executables-windows-linux)** article for better explanation and examples.
