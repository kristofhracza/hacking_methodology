# Basic Information
**Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (MSRPC)** is Microsoft’s implementation of the DCE/RPC protocol, enabling software components to communicate over a network by executing procedures on remote systems, commonly used for services like Active Directory, file sharing, and Windows management tasks.

## Ports
MSRPC uses TCP port **135** as the RPC Endpoint Mapper, which handles the initial client request by directing it to the correct service and dynamic port. TCP port **593**, on the other hand, is used when MSRPC is configured to operate directly over HTTP, allowing RPC over *HTTP* communication—commonly used in scenarios like Outlook Anywhere or remote management through firewalls.
