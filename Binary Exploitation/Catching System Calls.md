# PTRACE
Sometimes (for CTFs mainly) a `PTRACE`is used to stop the program from properly executing. Once loaded into **gdb** it can be bypassed:
```
Lines:
catch syscall ptrace
commands 1
	set ($rax) = 0
	end
	
Example:
┌──(kristof㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ gdb <FILENAME>
(gdb) catch syscall ptrace
Catchpoint 1 (syscall 'ptrace' [101])
(gdb) commands 1
Type commands for breakpoint(s) 1, one per line.
End with a line saying just "end".
>set ($rax) = 0
>end
```
This will allow one to bypass the stop created by `PTRACE` and can now follow the normal execution of the binary.
