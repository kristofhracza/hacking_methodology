This collection serves as a foundation for penetration testing methodology. Previously, these notes only covered basic enumeration and privilege escalation tips, however, this version will add more nuanced and sophisticated attacks, techniques and so forth. However, please do keep in mind, that not all possibilities are documented for one particular vulnerability, so please refer to the *References* sections for more information about any given vulnerability.
Also, many of the content is taken from and inspired by [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/index.html) for clarity. I would also like to note and acknowledge that even the layout is nearly the same, but this is what works best for me.

Please consider using this as a source of help should you need it.

To start off this guide I will remind both you and I to think with common sense and follow Occam's Razor.

# Rookie Rules
Some of these "rules" are more CTF-centric as opposed to real life pen testing.
- [ ] Assume that the easiest path is the best (Occam's razor)
- [ ] Enumerate every new finding and connect to previously obtained information
- [ ] Code which was not written by you, such as; exploits, shall be read before usage
- [ ] Read the manual page of tools of which you are unfamiliar with
- [ ] Take notes along the way. Both for learning and presentation purposes.

# Notes
This is not a finished site. I will keep on adding information that I believe to be useful, and as always these notes and its material are intended to be used for educational and informational purposes only!

Please, also read the articles that are linked in the *References* sections as they cover each topic in more detail as well as show techniques that I might have missed or deemed to be an edge case to document. Some URLs also link to tools which might save you some headache.
